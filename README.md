Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

 - Artemis Financial is a client that specializes in financial advising in several forms who is seeking to modernize their program by updating the security features associated with the program they utilize for their RESTful web application. For this program we were tasked with conducting security checks and creating new security implementations of the current and existing system.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

 - In identifying security vulnerabilities, I feel that I was very effective at ensuring that I was thourough in researching my topics. I spent a large sum of time across the different assignments this program had to ensure that what I was doing was not only functionally accurate and acceptable, but also efficient to the needs of the business. I think this ultimately aided in my understanding of secure coding, and helped me to implement that in my own practices. Secure coding is of paramount importance to the longevity of a program or service. This ties in very heavily to the overall wellbeing of the company as it shows a positive outlook on company security to the public, while taking internal measurses as a matter of extreme importance.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

 - I think that ultimately the most difficult part about the process of working through the vulnerabilites was just identifying what truly was and was not a vulnerability. due to the sheer number of vulnerabilites that are idenitifed in the report, it can be overwheling to see a list of 50 plus vulnerabilites where maybe five or six are flase positives. It was very helpful for me in the process of identifying true vulnerabilities when there were descriptor tags on the NVD database. While I still needed to check to make sure that it was valid, it made finding patches and potential fixes easier.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

 - I approached the need to increase layers of protection from a top-down viewpoint in the sense that I took the needs as they came up. I think ultimately a more proactive approach is the way to go to ensure proper security throughout. Additionally, to identify and assess vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques, I would conduct large amounts of research about current protection techniques as compared to the systems in place, and identify points of vulnerabilities and ways to address them through added layers of security.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

 - I ensured that the code and application were functional and secure by conducting testing through several phases of the process of development. This aided in identifying if I created new vulnerabilities or not, as it was visible to me at each phase of development that I undertook.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

 - YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow were fantastic resources in identifying ways to utilize and implement different componenets of the assignments I completed. These at times were pivotal in my success and workshopping different ways to attack a problem I was having with implementing different security fixes.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

 - Ideally, I would love to showcase the vulnerability assessment report, as I feel that I did a really nice job completing that assignment. I felt as though I was very thourough in my research, as well as succinct and to the point when it comes to identifying the different vulnerabilites. I also believe that this project showcases a well thought out mitigation plan, typical of something that would be found in the industry.
